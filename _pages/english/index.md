<h2 class="p1">About</h2>
<p class="p1">The Icelandic Pirate Party was founded on November 24th, 2012 based on the political ideology of the Swedish Pirate Party, which Richard Falkvinge founded in January 2006, to bring about internet copyright reform.</p>
<p class="p1">There are now Pirate parties in over 60 countries. They each have their own policies and priorities, but all are united in calling for the protection and enhancement of civil rights, including free speech and the right to privacy.</p>
<p class="p1">In the parliamentary elections of 2013, the Icelandic Pirate Party received 5% of the popular vote. Three Pirates became members of the Icelandic Parliament: <a href="http://www.althingi.is/altext/cv/en/?nfaerslunr=165">Helgi Hrafn Gunnarsson</a>, <a href="http://www.althingi.is/altext/cv/en/?nfaerslunr=143">Birgitta Jónsdóttir</a> and <a href="http://www.althingi.is/altext/cv/en/?ksfaerslunr=166">Jón Thór Ólafsson</a>. Jón Thór stepped aside in 2015 and his deputy, <a href="http://www.althingi.is/altext/cv/en/?nfaerslunr=178">Ásta Guðrún Helgadóttir</a>, took his seat in parliament. Pirates also have one representative in Reykjavik City Council, <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=is&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Freykjavik.is%2Fborgarfulltruar%2Fhalldor-audar-svansson&amp;edit-text=">Halldór Auðar Svansson</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">In the October 2016 elections, the Icelandic Pirates received 14,5% of the popular vote and gained seven additional representatives in parliament, for a total of ten.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Core Policy</h2>
<p class="p1">The Icelandic Pirate Party's core policies include direct democracy, transparency, civil rights, the right to self-determination, public access to information and responsible decision making. The <a href="http:localhost/en/core-policy">core policy text</a> forms the basis for all policymaking. In addition, all pirates can choose to uphold the international <a href="http:localhost/en/the-pirate-codex">Pirate Codex</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Pirate Party Policies</h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="http:localhost/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Piratafani4web.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-37326 alignright" src="http:localhost/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Piratafani4web-150x150.jpg" alt="Piratafani4web" width="150" height="150" /></a>The Icelandic Pirate Party's adoption of a policy hinges on the ability to root it firmly in the core policies of the party. It must also receive sufficient support in the Pirate Party's online voting system. The online voting system is the primary method through which Pirates settle disputes and reach consensus on policies. All accepted policies are published and viewable in Icelandic at <a href="https://x.piratar.is">x.piratar.is</a>. For English translations of particular policy texts, please contact members of the <a href="mailto:framkvaemdarad@piratar.is">Executive Council</a> or look for an English-speaking meeting on the <a href="http://www.piratar.is/vidburdir">Pirate event calendar</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Democracy in Action</h2>
<p class="p1">All Pirate Party work depends on the participation of individuals. The party's discussions are spread over in-house meetings, social media and various online groups. A great deal of the dialogue takes place on Facebook pages, but there are also more focused web discussions at <a href="https://discourse.piratar.is">discourse.piratar.is</a> where Icelandic Pirates debate, interact and reach consensus on a variety of topics. Meetings are advertised via email and social media, as well as on the <a href="http://www.piratar.is/vidburdir">Pirate event calendar</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Participate</h2>
<p class="p1">There are always interesting projects and discussions going on within the Pirate Party. The more good people we have working with us, the better our decisions and discussions become. You can contact us, show up at our meetings or even organise a meeting through your own initiative. Our email is <a href="mailto:piratar@piratar.is">piratar@piratar.is</a> and we can be reached by phone at +354 564 2000.</p>

In order to vote in our web based voting system, you must also register at <a href="http://x.piratar.is">x.piratar.is</a> using the <a href="http://www.island.is/en/icekey">IceKey</a> if one is available to you as a resident of Iceland.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Meetings for New Recruits</h2>
<p class="p1">Introductory meetings are held first Monday of every month. These meetings provide an excellent opportunity to meet other Pirates and learn about the Pirate Party. If you look up "Píratar" in a search engine, you will find a long list of discussion groups, including the English speaking Pirate Party Iceland chat group. Most of the internet discussion groups are on Facebook.</p>
