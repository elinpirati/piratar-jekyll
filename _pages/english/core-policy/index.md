<p><em><strong>Below you can find the core policy of The Pirate Party of Iceland. The policy is written as a series of statements so it is easy to quote them, but sometimes it can be a bit tricky to understand what is being referred to. Here are some definitions:<br />
</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Civil rights</strong></em> are the legally protected rights that an individual has to participation in a democratic society. Civil rights include but are not limited to the right to vote, religious freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and the right to engage in peaceful protest.</li>
<li><em><strong>Information</strong></em> is that which informs, i.e., that from which data can be derived. Information is conveyed either as the contents of a message or through direct or indirect observation of some thing. That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, information is always conveyed as the contents of a message. Information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation. For example, information may be encoded into signs, and transmitted via signals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. Critical thinking and well-informed policy</strong></p>
<p>1.1 Pirates emphasize critical thinking and well-informed decisions.<br />
1.2 This entails that Pirates shape their policy on the basis of data and knowledge which is gathered irrespective of whether or not the policy seems desirable or not at first. The position of Pirates on ideas is not based on who promotes them.<br />
1.3 Former decisions made by Pirates always need be open for revisions.<br />
1.4 The right of individuals to be informed shall never be impaired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Civil rights</strong></p>
<p>2.1 Pirates exert themselves for the enhancement and protection of civil rights.<br />
2.2 The expansion of civil rights shall aim to enhance other rights.<br />
2.3 Current rights must be guarded so that they will not be impaired.<br />
2.4 Pirates believe that civil rights belong to individuals and that the rights of every person is equally strong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. A right to privacy</strong></p>
<p>3.1 A right to privacy is about protecting the powerless from the abuse and mistreatment of the powerful.<br />
3.2 Pirates believe that all individuals should have a right to privacy in their own personal lives.<br />
3.3 Privacy includes the rights to discretion, the right to be anonymous and the right to self-determination.<br />
3.4 Secrecy should never go further than to protect the individual and never go so far as to affect other individuals.<br />
3.5 Anonymity does not relieve any person of responsibility for their actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Transparency and responsibility</strong></p>
<p>4.1 Transparency gives the powerless the power to monitor the powerful.<br />
4.2 Pirates believe that transparency is an important part of making the public informed and thereby capable of making democratic decisions.<br />
4.3 Information should be accessible to the public.<br />
4.4 Information should be accessible in open data formats, in a form that is most convenient for the usability of the information.<br />
4.5 In order for an individual to be able to take responsibility, she needs to have the ability to make decisions.<br />
4.6 Pirates believe that everyone has an unlimited right to be involved in decisions that relate to their own affairs, and a right to knowledge about how such decisions are made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Freedom of information and expression</strong></p>
<p>5.1 Limits to people’s freedom to collect and share information are unacceptable, except for the purpose of protecting the rights of individuals.<br />
5.2 Any limits to people’s freedom to express themselves are unacceptable, except for the purpose of protecting the rights of individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Direct democracy and the right to self-determination</strong></p>
<p>6.1 Pirates believe that everyone has an unlimited right to be involved in decisions that relate to their own affairs.<br />
6.2 That right is guaranteed with the empowerment of direct democracy and the promotion of transparent governance.<br />
6.3 Pirates believe that centralization needs to be reduced in all areas and democracy needs to be promoted in all the forms that are available.</p>
