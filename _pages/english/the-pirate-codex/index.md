<p><strong>Pirates are free</strong></p>
<p>Pirates are freedom-loving, independent, autonomous, and disapprove of blind obedience. They stand for informational self-determination and freedom of opinion. Pirates bear the responsibility entailed by freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates respect privacy</strong></p>
<p>Pirates protect privacy. They fight against the increasing surveillance mania of state and economy because it prohibits the free development of the individual. A free and democratic society is impossible without private and unobserved free space.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates are critical</strong></p>
<p>Pirates are creative, curious, and do not acquiesce in the status quo. They challenge systems, search for weak spots and find ways to correct them. Pirates learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates are fair-minded</strong></p>
<p>They keep their word. Solidarity is important when it comes to collective aims. Pirates counteract the blind-eye-mentality of society and take action when moral courage is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates respect life</strong></p>
<p>Pirates are peaceful. Therefore they reject the death penalty and the destruction of our environment. Pirates stand for the sustainability of nature and its resources. We do not accept patents on life.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates are eager for knowledge</strong></p>
<p>The access to information, education, knowledge and scientific findings has to be unlimited. Pirates support free culture and free software.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates are social</strong></p>
<p>Pirates respect human dignity. They commit themselves to a society united in solidarity where the strong defend the weak. Pirates stand for a political culture of objectivity and fairness.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates are international</strong></p>
<p>Pirates are part of a global movement. They take advantage of the opportunities offered by the internet and are therefore enabled to think and act without borders.</p>
